  abstract = {Information theory is a mathematical theory of learning with deep connections with topics as diverse as artificial intelligence, statistical physics, and biological evolution. Many primers on the topic paint a broad picture with relatively little mathematical sophistication, while many others develop specific application areas in detail. In contrast, these informal notes aim to outline some elements of the information-theoretic "way of thinking," by cutting a rapid and interesting path through some of the theory's foundational concepts and theorems. We take the Kullback-Leibler divergence as our foundational concept, and then proceed to develop the entropy and mutual information. We discuss some of the main foundational results, including the Chernoff bounds as a characterization of the divergence; Gibbs' Theorem; and the Data Processing Inequality. A recurring theme is that the definitions of information theory support natural theorems that sound "obvious" when translated into English. More pithily, "information theory makes common sense precise." Since the focus of the notes is not primarily on technical details, proofs are provided only where the relevant techniques are illustrative of broader themes. Otherwise, proofs and intriguing tangents are referenced in liberally-sprinkled footnotes. The notes close with a highly nonexhaustive list of references to resources and other perspectives on the field.},

  abstract = {Networks of dyadic relationships between entities have emerged as a dominant paradigm for modeling complex systems. Many empirical "networks"-such as collaboration networks; co-occurence networks; and communication networks-are intrin-sically polyadic, with multiple entities interacting simultaneously. Historically, such polyadic data has been represented dyadically via a standard projection operation. While convenient, this projection often has unintended and uncontrolled impact on downstream analysis, especially null hypothesis-testing. In this work, we develop a class of random null models for polyadic data in the framework of hypergraphs, therefore circumventing the need for projection. The null models we define are uniform on the space of hypergraphs sharing common degree and edge dimension sequences, and thus provide direct generalizations of the classical configuration model of network science. We also Metropolis-Hastings algorithms in order to sample from these spaces. We then apply the model to study two classical network topics-clustering and assortativity-as well as one contemporary, polyadic topic-simplicial closure. In each application, we emphasize the importance of randomizing over hypergraph space rather than projected graph space, showing that this choice can dramatically alter directional study conclusions and statistical findings. For example, we find that many of social networks we study are less clustered than would be expected at random, a finding in tension with much conventional wisdom within network science. Our findings underscore the importance of carefully choosing appropriate null spaces for polyadic relational data, and demonstrate the utility of random hypergraphs in many study contexts.}

Hypergraph data, in which entities interact on edges of arbitrary size, poses challenges for matrix representations and therefore for spectral clustering. We study spectral clustering for nonuniform hypergraphs based on the hypergraph nonbacktracking operator. After reviewing the definition of this operator and its basic properties, we prove a theorem of Ihara-Bass type which allows eigenpair computations to take place on a smaller matrix, often enabling faster computation. We then propose an alternating algorithm for inference in a hypergraph stochastic blockmodel via linearized belief-propagation which involves a spectral clustering step again using nonbacktracking operators. We provide proofs related to this algorithm that both formalize and extend several previous results. We pose several conjectures about the limits of spectral methods and detectability in hypergraph stochastic blockmodels in general, supporting these with in-expectation analysis of the eigeinpairs of our studied operators. We perform experiments in real and synthetic data that demonstrate the benefits of hypergraph methods over graph-based ones when interactions of different sizes carry different information about cluster structure.},

We propose a generative model of time-varying networks in which endorsements between individuals give rise to enduring hierarchies. For several network-based ranking functions, our model possesses a distinct, analytically tractable, critical transition between egalitarian and hierarchical states. We also use our model to explore hierarchical structures in empirical data on hiring patterns among mathematicians, dominance relations among parakeets, and friendships among members of a fraternity, observing several persistent patterns. Overall, our model enables data-informed modeling of hierarchical networks in social and biological systems.           ,              Many social and biological systems are characterized by enduring hierarchies, including those organized around prestige in academia, dominance in animal groups, and desirability in online dating. Despite their ubiquity, the general mechanisms that explain the creation and endurance of such hierarchies are not well understood. We introduce a generative model for the dynamics of hierarchies using time-varying networks, in which new links are formed based on the preferences of nodes in the current network and old links are forgotten over time. The model produces a range of hierarchical structures, ranging from egalitarianism to bistable hierarchies, and we derive critical points that separate these regimes in the limit of long system memory. Importantly, our model supports statistical inference, allowing for a principled comparison of generative mechanisms using data. We apply the model to study hierarchical structures in empirical data on hiring patterns among mathematicians, dominance relations among parakeets, and friendships among members of a fraternity, observing several persistent patterns as well as interpretable differences in the generative mechanisms favored by each. Our work contributes to the growing literature on statistically grounded models of time-varying networks.},

Many polyadic interactions are asymmetric, with nodes playing distinctive roles. In an academic collaboration network, for example, the order of authors on a paper often reflects the nature of their contributions to the completed work. To model these networks, we introduce               annotated hypergraphs               as natural polyadic generalizations of directed graphs. Annotated hypergraphs form a highly general framework for incorporating metadata into polyadic graph models. To facilitate data analysis with annotated hypergraphs, we construct a role-aware configuration null model for these structures and prove an efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo scheme for sampling from it. We proceed to formulate several metrics and algorithms for the analysis of annotated hypergraphs. Several of these, such as assortativity and modularity, naturally generalize dyadic counterparts. Other metrics, such as local role densities, are unique to the setting of annotated hypergraphs. We illustrate our techniques on six digital social networks, and present a detailed case-study of the Enron email data set.},

The tools developed in this paper enable flexible, multiscalar forms of analysis and visualization for spatial segregation. These tools illuminate how spatial boundaries between demographic groups contribute to overall segregation, those boundaries change over time, and the scale of segregation varies throughout a region. They apply to both ethnoracial and income segregation and can be used to study large geographic datasets.           ,              Ethnoracial residential segregation is a complex, multiscalar phenomenon with immense moral and economic costs. Modeling the structure and dynamics of segregation is a pressing problem for sociology and urban planning, but existing methods have limitations. In this paper, we develop a suite of methods, grounded in information theory, for studying the spatial structure of segregation. We first advance existing profile and decomposition methods by posing two related regionalization methods, which allow for profile curves with nonconstant spatial scale and decomposition analysis with nonarbitrary areal units. We then formulate a measure of local spatial scale, which may be used for both detailed, within-city analysis and intercity comparisons. These methods highlight detailed insights in the structure and dynamics of urban segregation that would be otherwise easy to miss or difficult to quantify.

We have generally lacked city-wide concentration measurements that resolve the steep spatiotemporal gradients of primary pollutants required to describe intra-urban air pollution inequality. Here, we use observations from the recently launched TROPospheric Ozone Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) satellite sensor and physics-based oversampling to describe nitrogen dioxide (NO               2               ) disparities with race, ethnicity, and income in 52 US cities (June 2018--February 2020). We report average US-urban census tract-level NO               2               inequalities of 28~{\textpm}~2\% (race-ethnicity and income combined), with many populous cities experiencing even greater inequalities. Using observations and inventories, we find diesel traffic is the dominant source of NO               2               disparities, and that a 62\% reduction in diesel emissions would decrease race-ethnicity and income inequalities by 37\%. We add evidence that TROPOMI resolves tract-scale NO               2               differences using relationships with urban segregation patterns and spatial variability in column-to-surface correlations.                        ,              Plain Language Summary             People of color and people with lower household incomes commonly experience higher levels of air pollution and worsened health burdens from poor air quality in US cities. We have lacked direct observations of air pollution across cities with which to describe, explain, and guide policymaking on air pollution disparities. Nitrogen dioxide is an important combustion pollutant that is co-emitted with many other toxic pollutants, and its concentrations are highly variable between neighborhoods. Here, we use nitrogen dioxide measurements collected from space by the TROPospheric Ozone Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) to describe inequalities within 52 US cities. TROPOMI captures greater spatial detail than previously possible, and the near-daily data collection allows for interpretation of the specific polluting sources causing nitrogen dioxide inequality, including diesel traffic emissions. Because satellite applications for air pollution inequality analyses are nascent, we build on our past work to advance understanding of the extent to which TROPOMI resolves inter-neighborhood nitrogen dioxide differences.           ,              Key Points                                                                                     On average, urban NO                     2                     inequalities of {$\sim$}28\% are observed with race-ethnicity and income; disparities are much greater in many cities                                                                                             Diesel traffic is the dominant source of NO                     2                     disparities; a 62\% reduction in diesel emissions would decrease inequalities by more than 37\%                                                                                             TROPOMI observations combined with oversampling resolve surface patterns in NO                     2                     disparities at the census-tract scale},

Unlike several recent algorithms based on canonical models, our microcanonical algorithm does not require inference of statistical parameters such as vertex degrees or pairwise group connection rates. Through synthetic experiments, we find that our algorithm succeeds down to recently-conjectured thresholds for sparse random hypergraphs.
